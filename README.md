# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course.  
The goal is to build a simple recipe website using only **HTML**.  
It will include a main index page and several subpages containing individual recipes.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Creating and structuring HTML documents
- Using headings, lists, links, and images
- Building a multi-page website with relative links
- Organizing project files and directories
- Using Git for version control and GitHub for remote storage

Once completed, this project will serve as a demonstration of my understanding of basic HTML structure and foundational Git workflow.
